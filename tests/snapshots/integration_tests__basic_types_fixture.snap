  /// A simple person struct
  pub struct Person {
    pub name: String

      /// Gets the person's name
      pub fn get_name(&self) -> &str
  }

  /// Implementation of Named trait for Person
  impl Named for Person {

    fn name(&self) -> &str
  }

  /// Different types of vehicles
  pub enum Vehicle {

    /// A car with number of doors
    Car(u8)

    /// A bicycle
    Bike

    /// A truck with cargo capacity in tons
    Truck { capacity: f32 }
  }

  /// A simple constant
  pub const MAX_USERS: usize

  /// Calculates the area of a rectangle
  pub fn rectangle_area(width: f64, height: f64) -> f64

  /// A trait for things that can be named
  pub trait Named {

    /// Returns the name
    fn name(&self) -> &str
  }
